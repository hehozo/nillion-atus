Nillion Python Starter <a href="https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter/blob/main/LICENSE"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg"></a>

This is a python starter repo for building on the Nillion Network. Complete environment setup, then run the examples:

- To run multi party examples, go to the [multi party compute](examples_and_tutorials/core_concept_multi_party_compute) folder.

- To run single party examples, go to the [single party compute](examples_and_tutorials/core_concept_single_party_compute) folder.

- To run permissions examples (storing and retrieving permissioned secrets, revoking permissions, etc.), go to the [permissions](examples_and_tutorials/core_concept_permissions) folder.

### Prerequisites: Install the CLI Dependencies

The `nillion-devnet` tool spins up `anvil` under the hood, so you need to have `foundry` installed. The [`bootstrap-local-environment.sh`](./bootstrap-local-environment.sh) file uses `pidof` and `grep`.

- [Install `foundry`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [Install `pidof`](https://command-not-found.com/pidof)
- [Install `grep`](https://command-not-found.com/grep)

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the sample:

   ```shell
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Create the virtual environment (`.venv`), install dependencies, and activate the virtual environment

   ```shell
   bash ./create_venv.sh && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Run the [`bootstrap-local-environment.sh`](./bootstrap-local-environment.sh) script to spin up `nillion-devnet`, generate keys, and get bootnodes, cluster, and payment info:

   ```shell
   ./bootstrap-local-environment.sh
   ```

3. Check `.env` file - keys, bootnodes, cluster, and payment info should now be present. If you want to run against a local cluster, use this configuration. Otherwise, replace values with testnet bootnodes, cluster, and payment info.

4. Look through the [programs](./programs/) folder to see examples of Nada programs.

## Compiling Programs

Nada programs need to be compiled ahead of being stored. Compile all programs in the [programs](./programs/) folder with the script [`compile_programs.sh`](./compile_programs.sh):

```shell
bash compile_programs.sh
```

This generates a `programs-compiled` folder containing the compiled programs.

## Store a Compiled Program

Store a compiled program in the network with this script:

```shell
bash store_program.sh {RELATIVE_COMPILED_PROGRAM_PATH}
```

To store the compiled [`addition_simple`](./programs/addition_simple.py) program you can run:

```shell
bash store_program.sh programs-compiled/addition_simple.nada.bin
```

Storing a program results in the stored `program_id`, the network's reference to the program. The `program_id` is the `{user_id}/{program_name}`.

## Testing

Most examples and tutorials within this repository can be tested. Docker is required to run the tests.

```shell
cd testing
bash run_tests.sh
```
